Besides the raised flat-topped ridge, plate has relief decoration on one part of rim (Fragment A): a raised area, broken across middle - preserved right side has inward-curving volute with long, round-tipped projection extending from its upper curve to edge of rim, and triangluar raised area over center with traces of an opposed volute on left edge - seems similar to the ""bean"" patterns of other pieces, e.g. 19710533.  Inner or upper surface of body has very shallow incised, almost burnished pattern of two parallel horizontal grooves above and below a band of straight, vertical incisions which are slightly uneven but roughly parallel - this is preserved entire on Fragment C, and in part on Fragments B and D.

The fragment has one finished edge 0.02027m long, which looks like a rim with a rounded profile.  Along one side of the rim is an ancient break.  On the opposite side is a section chipped in antiquity, max. pres. height: 0.02619m.  Adjacent to the chipped section is another finished edge which begins almost perpendicular to the finished rim edge, but then after 0.00764m carinates in an arc roughly at just under a ninety degree angle to the finished rim.  The curve arcs for only 0.00510m before it is terminated by another ancient break edge.  Both the interior and exterior faces are finished, with the interior showing several signs of finishing and smoothing out the fabric which are oriented at a forty-five degree angle to the rim.  The fragment tapers and also twists from the rim towards the ancient break edges so that the fabric is not of a consistent thickness, again possibly pointing to it being hand produced instead of wheel thrown."

Three ancient and two modern break edges.  Worn, pitted, abraded, and slightly encrusted. Consolidated from seventeen pieces.",,"An incised and stamped bucchero ribbon handle fragment with portions of the rim and tondo preserved.  The interior face is finished and decorated with incision and stamps.  In the interior of the preserved portion of tondo are four incised lines.  Projecting from the break edge through the tondo is a partly preserved vesica piscis shaped incision (max. pres. length 0.007m, max. pres. width 0.004m, max. pres. thickness 0.001m).  0.002m from the tip of the vesica piscis is an arcing line (line one; max. pres. thickness 0.003m) which begins to make an 'S' curve before being obscured by the break edge through the tondo.  Two more incised lines begin 0.001m (line two; max. pres. thickness 0.001m) and 0.003m (line three; max. pres. thickness 0.002m) from the first curved incision; lines two and three are initially parallel to line one, but after a vertical length about 0.016m diverge from line one, but remain roughly parallel to one another.  Lines two and three also turn back towards themselves in an 'S' curve of a different profile from that of line one.  In combination these four incisions perhaps represent the hindquarters of a quadruped (either real or mythical).  Adjacent to the small, preserved portion of rim and extending up onto the projecting ribbon handle are portions of nine stamped decorations each made up of six impressions in a triangular shape.  Each stamp is about 0.007m in height and 0.004m maximum width.  Each impression is roughly 0.001m in width, and separated from the next by 0.001m.  In a register 0.002m away from the triangular stamps are portions of seven impressions running laterally down the handle.  Each line is 0.002m in width and max. pres. length of 0.006m in length; they are separated from one another by 0.003m.  If these extended further up the handle where it is now broken, they may have formed a ribbed decoration.  The exterior face of the fragment preserves vessel exterior as well as a handle attachment.  The handle attachment is decorated with two registers of the triangle stamp.  In the first register, portions of six triangular stamps are preserved.  In the second register portions of nine triangle stamps are preserved.  A third register closest to where the handle attaches to the body preserves portions of four dashed lines created by a roller stamp (max. pres. width 0.048m; max. pres. length of dash 0.001m; max. pres distance between dash 0.001m).  Where the handle edge is preserved two dashed lines also made with a roller stamp in the same fashion run parallel to the finished edge and perpendicular to the lines which comprise the triangular stamps."
